# I'm missing a day of comics as I speak because I've only got a Mac and I haven't scripted for the Mac yet.
# So ..
# Feature Request 1: How about a feature that let's me catch up on days that I've missed?
# Run the script with a '-2' or something in order to pick up comics from two days ago, etc.
# Would be tricky.  But it's a good idea.
#
# Feature Request 2: A special binge-reading mode.  This would be for reading all of a particular site's comics, if possible, loading four at a time as usual.
